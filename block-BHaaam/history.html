        <p>Paleontologists and archaeologists have determined that about 60 million years ago a small mammal, rather <br>
            like a weasel, lived in the environs of what are now parts of Asia. It is called Miacis, the genus that <br>
            became the ancestor of the animals known today as canids: dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes. Miacis did <br>
            not leave direct descendants, but doglike canids evolved from it. By about 30 to 40 million years ago <br>
            Miacis had evolved into the first true dogâ€”namely, Cynodictis. This was a medium-size animal, longer <br>
            than it was tall, with a long tail and a fairly brushy coat. Over the millennia Cynodictis gave rise <br>
            to two branches, one in Africa and the other in Eurasia. The Eurasian branch was called Tomarctus and <br>
            is the progenitor of wolves, dogs, and foxes.</p>

        <p>Dogs have played an important role in the history of human civilization and were among the first <br>
            domesticated animals. They were important in hunter-gatherer societies as hunting allies and bodyguards <br>
            against predators. When livestock were domesticated about 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, dogs served as herders<br>
            and guardians of sheep, goats, and cattle. Although many still serve in these capacities, dogs are mainly <br>
            used for social purposes and companionship. Today dogs are employed as guides for the blind and disabled or <br>
            for police work. Dogs are even used in therapy in nursing homes and hospitals to encourage patients toward <br>
            recovery. Humans have bred a wide range of different dogs adapted to serve a variety of functions. This has <br>
            been enhanced by improvements in veterinary care and animal husbandry.</p>
