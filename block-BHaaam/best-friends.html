        <p class="para">Dogs, often hailed as humans’ best friends, have been the topic of many <br>
            scientific studies looking into how they might boost our well-being. In this Spotlight, <br>
            we’ll explain how your friendly pup can benefit your health across the board.According to <br>
            the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), an estimated 78 million <br>
            dogs are owned as pets in the United States.It is unclear when dogs were first domesticated, but <br>
            a studyTrusted Source published last year claims that, at least in Europe, dogs were tamed <br>
            20,000–40,000 years ago.</p>

        <p class="para">Many studies have suggested that having dogs as pets is associated with better <br>
            physical health, as reviewsTrusted Source of the existing literature show. These findings persist.<br>
            Dogs ‘force’ their owners to take daily exercise.<br>
            Just last year, Medical News Today reported on a study that showed that owning a dog reduces a person’s risk<br> 
            of premature death by up to a third.<br>
            Also, researchers at the University of Harvard in Cambridge, MA, suggest that dog owners have<br> 
            a lower risk of heart disease.</p>
