        <h1>The Great Himalayas</h1>
        <p>Stretching for more than 2,500 km from the East to West, and 250 km to 400 km from South 
            to North, the Himalayan Mountain Ranges are one of the natural wonders of the world. 
            With several tall peaks and rivers, the mountain ranges are a favourite site for ecotourism enthusiasts. 
            The Himalayas are home to some of the most famous peaks in India like the Kanchenjungha and Nanda Devi. 
            You can participate in exciting adventure sports and activities such as rock climbing, trekking, nature walk, 
            whitewater rafting, camping, and mountain biking. Mount Everest is the tallest peak in the Himalayan Mountain Range. This range encompasses the whole northern portion of India, located in five important states of the country. In the Sanskrit Language, the Himalayas stand for “Abode of Snow”.</p> 
             <h2>Aravalli Mountains Ranges</h2>
             <p>Stretching for approximately 300 miles over Rajasthan, the Aravalli Mountain Ranges <br>
                are one of the oldest mountain ranges in the world. Extending over a large region, these <br>
                ranges save the cities of Rajasthan from the harsh deserts.</p>   
             <h3>Mountains In Himachal Pradesh</h3>
        
             <p>Mountains in Himachal Pradesh have similarities with the mountains of Austria. <br>
                The state is the territory of snow, picturesque waterfalls, the valley of fruits, and highland pastures.<br> 
                The capital of Himachal Pradesh is Shimla. If you spend some time in the state, you will forget that you <br>
                are still in India. The diverse blend of culture and people would astonish you. Popular tourist spots include <br>
                McLeod Ganj and Dharamsala. Manali is famous among adventure sports lovers, and Shimla is a favourite place<br> 
                for romantic couples.<br>

                Mountains in Himachal Pradesh are famous for their hill stations. These hill stations <br>
                are especially fresh even during the summer months. Dalhousie, Shimla, Manali, Kullu, and Kufri <br>
                are some of the hill stations in the state. All these hill stations provide spectacular views and <br>
                unlimited adventure sports options. Dharamshala, which is the official residence of the Dalai Lama, is one<br> 
                more major tourist attraction.<br>
