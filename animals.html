            <h1>Wildlife of INDIA</h1>

        <p>When most people think of Indian animals, the Royal Bengal Tiger is usually the first species that springs to mind. 
            And with good reason: The subcontinent is home to more than half of the world’s wild tigers, with a thriving population 
            in nearly 50 tiger reserves.

            But the national animal of India is hardly the only endemic species of Indian wildlife. <Br>
            In fact, India is home to approximately 7.6% of the world’s species of mammals, 12.6% of its bird species, and 6.2%<br> 
            of its reptiles. <br>
            
            Protected by more than 120 national parks, 18 Biosphere reserves, and 500+ wildlife sanctuaries, the animals<br> 
            of India are vast and varied. It’s the only country in the world where you have a relatively good chance of <br>
            seeing (Asiatic) Lions, (Bengal and Indochinese) Tigers, and (Sloth) Bears.<br>
            
            Other iconic species of wild animals in India include Asian Elephants, Snow Leopards, Clouded Leopards, the<br> 
            Great Indian Rhinoceros, Deer (including Barasingha, Chital, and Hangul), the Dhole (a.k.a. Indian Wild Dog),<br> 
            and endemics such as the Nigiri Leaf Monkey.<br>

            of the country’s most fascinating apex predators, birds, mammals, and reptiles.<br>

        <h1>Bngal Tiger</h1>
    <p>The Bengal tiger is renowned for its power and strength. They live primarily in India, but can also be<br> 
        found in Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, and China.<br>

        The female Bengal tiger gives birth to litters of 2-6 cubs, which they raise with a little help from the male, <br>
        or no help at all. The tiger cubs start hunt when they’re around 18 months old and stay with their mother for <br>
        around 2-3 years before leaving to find their own territory.<br>
        
        The Bengal tiger is not only one of the most powerful animals in India, but it’s also India’s national animal.</p> 
             <h2>INDIAN Elephant</h2>
             <p>The elephant is one of the biggest mammals on earth, and therefore one of the biggest <br>
                animals in India. Elephants live in a matriarchal family group of related females called a herd. <br>
                A herd can consist of around 100 elephants, and it’s often led by the oldest and largest female.<br>

                Indian elephants like to eat grass, roots, fruits, and leaves. A fun fact is that they can eat <br>
                about 330 pounds of food a day.</p>   
             <h3>INDIAn Rhinoceros</h3>
            
             <p>The Indian rhinoceros lives primarily in northern India and Nepal. These big animals look a bit different <br>
                from their African relatives. The skin of the Indian rhinoceros makes it look like they have a natural body<br>
            armor on – which is very different from the African rhinoceros.</p>
